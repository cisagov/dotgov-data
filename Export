The [.gov top-level domain](https://get.gov) exists so that the online services of U.S.-based government organizations are easy to identify on the internet. In support of that goal, the .gov registry publishes information about our domains.

This repository contains the official, full list of registered domains in the .gov zone. The U.S. Government's executive, legislative, and judicial branches are represented, as are many state, territory, tribal, city, and county governments in the United States.

Three files are updated daily (when there is activity):
* [gov.txt](https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data/blob/main/gov.txt) – a copy of the .gov zone file
* [current-full.csv](https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data/blob/main/current-full.csv) – a CSV of all domains in the zone, including federal domains
* [current-federal.csv](https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data/blob/main/current-federal.csv) – a CSV of only federal domains in the zone

current-full.csv and current-federal.csv contain the same registered domains as the zone file, but instead of name server records they detail the registrant organization. They include all domains in the "Ready" and "On hold" states of our [registrar](https://github.com/cisagov/manage.get.gov/). 

Each file lists the "second-level domains" (e.g., get.gov) that are registered in the .gov zone; they do not list every _hostname_ (e.g., manage.get.gov) in use in the .gov namespace. This repo hosts several other files that include .gov hostnames, though they are not complete.

Note that not all registered domains offer an online service (e.g., a website, an email server) at the domain.
